let sql = `sqlc is not strictly a conventional ORM. 
It offers a unique approach by generating 
Go code from SQL queries. This allows developers 
to write SQL, which sqlc then converts into type-safe 
Go code, reducing the boilerplate significantly. 
It ensures that your queries are syntactically correct and 
type-safe. sqlc is ideal for those who prefer writing 
SQL and are looking for an efficient way to integrate 
it into a Go application. Here at Encore we really like 
sqlc, so much so that we wrote a whole blog post about it. ${message} - ${pi}`
